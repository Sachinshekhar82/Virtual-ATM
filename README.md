The Virtual ATM project focuses on creating a software-based ATM system using Python, incorporating a graphical user interface (GUI) and speech recognition. The system is designed to replicate essential ATM functionalities such as checking bank balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money. By integrating speech recognition, the project enhances user interaction, making it accessible to visually impaired individuals and those preferring voice commands. This system eliminates the need for physical ATMs, offering a cost-effective and innovative solution for digital banking.

Key Features:
User-friendly GUI for ease of access.
Speech recognition for interactive banking.
Core banking operations: check balance, deposit, and withdraw.
Enhanced accessibility for diverse user groups.

Aim:
To develop a Python-based Virtual ATM system that provides basic banking functionalities through GUI and speech recognition for secure and accessible banking.

Objectives:
Develop Core Functionalities: Implement basic banking operations such as balance inquiry, cash deposit, and cash withdrawal.
Integrate GUI: Design a simple, intuitive graphical interface using Python libraries like Tkinter etc.
Speech Recognition: Implement speech recognition to enable voice commands for banking tasks, ensuring inclusivity.
Security: Include basic security measures such as user authentication via PIN.
Error Handling: Ensure smooth operation with robust error handling for invalid inputs or speech recognition errors.

Step 1: Requirement Analysis
Identify core functions:
Checking account balance.
Depositing money.
Withdrawing money.
Select technologies: Python, Tkinter (or PyQt), SpeechRecognition library.
Step 2: System Design
GUI Design:
      Main screen with buttons for “Check Balance,” “Deposit Money,” and “Withdraw Money.”
       Input fields for amount entry and PIN authentication.
Speech Recognition:
Use SpeechRecognition Python library to interpret voice commands like “Check balance” or “Withdraw 500.”
Database:
Use a simple database (SQLite or Python dictionaries) to store and manage user account details.<img width="2013" height="765" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/004c26ab-67ac-4066-bd81-6250bed27757" />
